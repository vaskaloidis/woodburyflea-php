The car shared its platform and major components with the Pontiac Firebird, also introduced for 1967.\r\nBefore any official announcement, reports began running during April 1965 within the automotive press that Chevrolet was preparing a competitor to the Ford Mustang, code-named Panther.[6] On June 21, 1966, around 200 automotive journalists received a telegram from General Motors stating, \"...Please save noon of June 28 for important SEPAW meeting. Hope you can be on hand to help scratch a cat. Details will follow...(signed) John L. Cutter â€“ Chevrolet Public Relations â€“ SEPAW Secretary.\" The following day, the same journalists received another General Motors telegram stating, \"Society for the Eradication of Panthers from the Automotive World will hold first and last meeting on June 28...(signed) John L. Cutter â€“ Chevrolet Public Relations SEPAW Secretary.\" These telegrams puzzled the automotive journalists.\r\n\r\nOn June 28, 1966, General Motors held a live press conference in Detroitâ€™s Statler-Hilton Hotel. It would be the first time in history that 14 cities were hooked up in real time for a press conference via telephone lines. Chevrolet General Manager Pete Estes started the news conference stating that all attendees of the conference were charter members of the Society for the Elimination of Panthers from the Automotive World and that this would be the first and last meeting of SEPAW. Estes then announced a new car line, project designation XP-836, with a name that Chevrolet chose in keeping with other car names beginning with the letter C such as the Corvair, Chevelle, Chevy II, and Corvette. He claimed the name, \"suggests the comradeship of good friends as a personal car should be to its owner\" and that \"to us, the name means just what we think the car will do... Go!\" The new Camaro name was then unveiled. Automotive press asked Chevrolet product managers, \"What is a Camaro?\" and were told it was \"a small, vicious animal that eats Mustangs.\"[7]','kaloidis','hartford.edu',0,1,0,'2014-11-09 00:00:00','2014-11-09 05:16:20','FALSE'),(509,'Macbook Pro Retina','THis is a macbook description','kaloidis','hartford.edu',29994,1,0,'2014-11-09 00:00:00','2014-11-09 14:12:13','FALSE'),(511,'Sterling Archer','This is a nice picture of Sterling Archer from Archer','kaloidis','hartford.edu',3099,1,0,'2014-11-10 00:00:00','2014-11-10 16:29:27','aa937c17c92041617ea66c3b3fca0b010893cdbc.jpg'),(512,'2007 Audi A8','This is a hot newer Audi.
